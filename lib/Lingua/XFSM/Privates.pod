=head1 NAME

Lingua::XFSM::Privates - Direct access to XFSM interface from Perl


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Lingua::XFSM version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::XFSM::Privates;

    my $context Lingua::XFSM::Privates::initialize_cfsm();
    Lingua::XFSM::Privates::reclaim_cfsm($context);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here be dragons! The following assumes familiarity with the low-level
interfaces generated by SWIG. See
L<the SWIG documentation|http://swig.org/Doc2.0/> for details, chapter 30 in
general and sections 30.4 and 30.9 in particular.

These bindings are generated with SWIG, using the following command line:
C<swig -perl5 -const xfsm.i>. This means that SWIG generates proxy classes and
struture members are available as hash entries. Constants are wrapped with
constant subs, so that the UPPER C<#define> is available as
C<Lingua::XFSM::Privates::UPPER> (not C<$Lingua::XFSM::Privates::UPPER>). All
the functions of the C interface are available as subs with the same name in
the C<Lingua::XFSM::Privates> namespace.

If the wrapper is loaded with C<use Lingua::XFSM::Privates> no initialisation
or destruction is performed. If C<use Lingua::XFSM> is used
C<Lingua::XFSM::Privates::initialize_cfsm()> is called at C<BEGIN> time and
the returned context is stored in C<$Lingua::XFSM::context>, and at C<END>
time it will be destroyed with C<Lingua::XFSM::reclaim_cfsm()>.
