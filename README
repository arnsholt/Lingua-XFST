This is Lingua::XFST, version 0.1.

Lingua::XFST is a (bare minimum) Perl interface to the Xerox finite state
libraries. Full access to the C API is available through
Lingua::XFST::Privates, but this requires knowledge on how the C library
works, and how SWIG generated interfaces work.

Having the Xerox library installed is (obviously) a prerequisite to get this
module working. If you don't already have it, you can download it from
http://fsmbook.com/. The libraries have to be available both to the linker,
and the privates/Makefile.PL script. This latter tries to be clever and looks
at LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OS X) to find the proper path, but if
setting the proper env var doesn't work you may have to hack
privates/Makefile.PL directly (this is an early version, after all).

The source repository is available at https://github.com/arnsholt/Lingua-XFST,
patches (and pull requests!), bug reports, feedback welcome.
